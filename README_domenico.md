<!-- ABOUT THE WORK WITH POWER BI -->
## About The Work with Power BI

Introduction

This project was supported by the Power BI software that gives a good help in the exploratory data analysis and visualization. The dataset for this competition, train, had also been used on  



<!-- DATA PREPARATION -->
## Data preparation
1) Task and Data description 
* Type: consisting of a letter L, M, or H for low, medium and high as product quality variants.
* air temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process later normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K.
* process temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K.
* rotational speed [rpm]: calculated from a power of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise.
* Torque [Nm]: torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm with a Ïƒ = 10 Nm and no negative values.
* Tool wear [min]: The quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool in the process.
* Machine failure: whether the machine has failed in this particular datapoint for any of the following failure modes are true. The machine failure consists of five independent failure modes

* Tool wear failure (TWF): the tool will be replaced of fail at a randomly selected tool wear time between 200 ~ 240 mins.
* Heat dissipation failure (HDF): heat dissipation causes a process failure, if the difference between air and process temperature is below 8.6 K and the rotational speed is below 1380 rpm.
* Power failure (PWF): the product of torque and rotational speed (in rad/s) equals the power required for the process. If this power is below 3500 W or above 9000 W, the process fails.
* Overstrain failure (OSF): if the product of tool wear and torque exceeds 11,000 minNm for the L product variant (12,000 M, 13,000 H), the process fails due to overstrain.
* Random failures (RNF): each process has a chance of 0,1 % to fail regardless of its process parameters.

If at least one of the above failure modes is true, the process fails and the 'machine failure' label is set to 1. It is therefore not transparent to the machine learning method, which of the failure modes has caused the process to fail.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
